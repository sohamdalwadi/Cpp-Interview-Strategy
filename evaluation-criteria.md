# üìù **Evaluation Criteria for C++ Interviews**

This document provides a structured approach to evaluating candidates' skills during C++ interviews. It is designed to ensure consistency and clarity for both interviewers and candidates.

---

## **1. Core C++ Knowledge (40%)**

Assess the candidate's understanding of fundamental C++ concepts.

### **Basic Concepts (15%)**
- Basic data types (int, char, float, etc.)
- Control structures (if, else, switch, loops)
- Functions, parameters, and return types
- Pointers and references
- Function overloading and function templates

### **Intermediate Concepts (15%)**
- Object-oriented programming (OOP): classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- File operations and input/output streams
- Dynamic memory management (malloc, free, new, delete)
- Exception handling (try, catch, throw)

### **Advanced Concepts (10%)**
- Templates and generic programming
- Smart pointers and RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
- Move semantics and rvalue references
- Rule of three/five

---

## **2. Problem-Solving Skills (30%)**

Evaluate the candidate's ability to analyze and solve problems efficiently.

### **Algorithm Design (15%)**
- Ability to design efficient algorithms
- Understanding of time complexity (Big O notation)
- Familiarity with common algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.)

### **Coding Ability (15%)**
- Writing clean, efficient, and readable code
- Handling edge cases and error conditions
- Debugging and optimizing code

---

## **3. System Design and Software Engineering (20%)**

Assess the candidate's ability to design scalable and maintainable systems.

### **System Design (10%)**
- Designing modular and extensible systems
- Understanding of concurrency and multithreading
- Knowledge of design patterns

### **Build and Development Tools (5%)**
- Familiarity with build systems (Make, CMake)
- Understanding compiler flags and optimization techniques
- Basic use of debugging tools (gdb)

### **Linux and Shell Scripting (5%)**
- Basic Linux commands and shell scripting
- Understanding file permissions and processes

---

## **4. Professional Attitude and Soft Skills (10%)**

Evaluate the candidate's professionalism and ability to work in a team.

### **Communication Skills (5%)**
- Ability to clearly explain technical concepts
- Effective collaboration in team settings
- Providing constructive feedback

### **Problem-Solving Approach (5%)**
- Logical and methodical approach to problem-solving
- Adaptability to new challenges and changing environments

---

## **5. Continuous Learning and Adaptability (Bonus Points)**

- Staying updated with the latest C++ standards and features
- Engagement in open-source projects or community contributions
- Initiative in self-learning and professional development

---

## **6. Overall Assessment**

### **Rating Scale**
- **Excellent (90-100)**: Outstanding performance across all areas.
- **Good (75-89)**: Strong performance with minor improvement areas.
- **Satisfactory (60-74)**: Meets basic requirements but needs significant improvement.
- **Needs Improvement (Below 60)**: Struggles with key concepts and skills.
