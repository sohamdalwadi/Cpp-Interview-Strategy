# üöÄ C++ Interview Strategy

This guide provides an outline for conducting **C++ technical interviews** with two different durations: **30 minutes** and **60 minutes**. It includes a balance of **core concepts**, **problem-solving tasks**, and **wrap-up** time for feedback and questions.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Interview Duration: 30 Minutes

### 1. **Quick Introduction** (5 minutes)
- **Introduce yourself** and explain the interview format.
- **Candidate Introduction**: Ask the candidate to briefly discuss their background, experience, and exposure to C++.

### 2. **Core C++ Concepts** (10 minutes)
Assess the candidate's knowledge in key areas:
- **Memory Management**: 
  - Pointers vs References
  - `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and manual memory management.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: 
  - Inheritance, polymorphism, and design patterns.
- **Modern C++ Features** (C++11/14/17/20): 
  - `std::move`, lambdas, `std::optional`, and `std::variant`.

### 3. **Problem-Solving** (15 minutes)
Choose one of the following to assess problem-solving skills:
- **Basic Algorithm**: Fibonacci, sorting, or array manipulation.
- **Data Structures**: Implementing a stack, queue, or linked list.
- **Memory Management**: Handling dynamic memory without memory leaks.

### 4. **Wrap-Up** (5 minutes)
- Allow the candidate to ask questions.
- **Summary**: Provide brief feedback and discuss next steps.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Interview Duration: 60 Minutes

### 1. **Quick Introduction** (5 minutes)

### 2. **In-Depth Core C++ Concepts** (15 minutes)
Dive deeper into advanced topics:
- **Advanced Memory Management**: Smart pointers, manual memory management, and multi-threading.
- **Multi-threading & Concurrency**: Understanding of mutexes, locks, and atomic operations.
- **Modern C++ Features**: Templates, SFINAE, constexpr, and advanced OOP topics.

### 3. **Problem-Solving** (35 minutes)
Choose two problems to evaluate technical skills:
- **First Problem** (15 minutes): Medium complexity, e.g., merging sorted arrays or recursion-based problems.
- **Second Problem** (20 minutes): Higher complexity, e.g., custom container implementation or concurrency challenges (e.g., producer-consumer problem).

### 4. **Wrap-Up** (5 minutes)
- Allow the candidate to ask questions.
- **Summary**: Provide a summary of performance, feedback, and next steps.

### üîë Key Tips for Interviewers:
- **Stay on time**: Stick to the durations for each section to keep the interview balanced.
- **Adjust based on the candidate**: If a candidate struggles with a topic, feel free to provide hints, but don‚Äôt give away the solution.
- **Be clear with expectations**: When giving problem-solving tasks, clearly explain the problem requirements and any constraints.
