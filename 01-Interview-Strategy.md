# C++ Interview Strategy

## Interview Duration: 30 Minutes

### 1. Quick Introduction (5 minutes)
- **Introduce yourself** and provide an overview of the interview format.
- **Candidate Introduction**: Ask the candidate to briefly talk about their experience, projects, and exposure to C++.

### 2. Core C++ Concepts (10 minutes)
- **Memory Management**: Explain the difference between pointers and references, `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and manual memory management.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Discuss inheritance, polymorphism, and design patterns.
- **C++11/14/17/20 Features**: Discuss modern C++ features like `std::move`, lambdas, `std::optional`, and `std::variant`.

### 3. Problem-Solving (15 minutes)
Choose one problem to assess:
- **Basic Algorithm Problem**: Fibonacci, sorting, or array manipulation.
- **Data Structures**: Implementing a stack, queue, or linked list.
- **Memory Management**: Handling dynamic memory and ensuring no memory leaks.

### 4. Wrap-Up (5 minutes)
- Allow the candidate to ask questions.
- Summarize the interview, provide feedback, and discuss next steps.
