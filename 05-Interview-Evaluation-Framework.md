## **Common, Role-Specific Questions**

To ensure a **consistent and fair evaluation** process, we recommend using **common questions for each section** that are mapped to the **role level**. These questions will be used to assess the candidate's **skills and knowledge** in a structured manner.

### Why Common Questions?

- **Fairness**: All candidates are evaluated using the same set of questions, allowing for an objective comparison.
- **Consistency**: Interviewers can apply the same criteria across all candidates, making the process standardized and reproducible.
- **Efficiency**: Predefined questions help streamline the interview process and ensure that the interview stays on track.
- **Clear Evaluation**: Role-specific questions allow for clearer, more targeted evaluations of a candidate’s abilities.

### How to Implement Common Questions?

1. **Core Set of Questions**: 
   - Some fundamental C++ topics are applicable at all levels, such as **basic syntax**, **memory management**, and **OOP concepts**.
   
2. **Tailored by Role Level**:
   - **Junior**: Focus on basic syntax, simple problem-solving, and understanding core C++ features.
   - **Mid-Level**: Includes questions on data structures, algorithms, and more complex C++ features.
   - **Senior**: Targets advanced topics like multithreading, optimization, and complex system design.
   - **Expert**: Focuses on deep knowledge, design patterns, system architecture, and leadership experience in C++ projects.

### Benefits of Role-Specific Questions

- **Standardized Process**: By using common questions, interviewers can ensure that each candidate is being evaluated on the same areas.
- **Fair Comparison**: It becomes easier to compare candidates from different backgrounds when they are asked the same type of questions tailored to their experience level.
- **Effective Interviewing**: The candidate can demonstrate their expertise in a structured manner, and the interviewers can identify strengths and gaps more clearly.

## **Final Scoring and Evaluation**

The **total score** is calculated as a weighted average based on the section scores:

$$
\text{Final Score} = (\text{Introduction Score} \times 0.05) + (\text{Experience Score} \times 0.25) + (\text{Theory Score} \times 0.15) + (\text{Outcome Score} \times 0.10) + (\text{Coding Task Score} \times 0.30) + (\text{Communication Score} \times 0.15)
$$

The **final score** will be a number between **1 and 5**. Interviewers can use this score as an overall measure of the candidate's performance and determine their fit for the role based on the score.

---

### **Conclusion**

This **quantitative evaluation rubric** ensures that all candidates are assessed on a consistent, objective basis, with clear criteria for each section of the interview. By applying this strategy, interviewers can accurately compare candidates and make informed decisions based on their technical proficiency and problem-solving skills.

---

### Notes:
- **No Score Range by Role Level**: Interviewers are encouraged to use the final score to assess whether the candidate is a good fit for the role. Based on the score, they can decide whether the candidate fits the profile of a **Junior**, **Mid-Level**, **Senior**, or **Expert** developer based on their overall performance.
- Each section’s weight reflects its importance, allowing interviewers to place more focus on critical areas such as **Experience** and **Coding Task**.
