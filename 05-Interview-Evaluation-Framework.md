## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Overall Scoring and Rating**

### **Step 1: Assign Ratings**  
Rate each category from **1 (Poor)** to **5 (Excellent)** based on the candidate's performance.

### **Step 2: Multiply Ratings by Weights**  
For each category, multiply the rating by its assigned weight (expressed as a percentage).

### **Step 3: Sum the Scores**  
Add up all the weighted scores to get the **final score**.

## **Sample Scoring Calculation**:

### **Technical Skills (Weight: 50%)**
- **Basic C++ Concepts (10%)**: Rating **4** ‚Üí 4 * 0.10 = **0.4**
- **Advanced C++ Concepts (10%)**: Rating **3** ‚Üí 3 * 0.10 = **0.3**
- **Problem Solving (10%)**: Rating **5** ‚Üí 5 * 0.10 = **0.5**
- **Coding Skills (10%)**: Rating **4** ‚Üí 4 * 0.10 = **0.4**

**Total for Technical Skills**: **1.6**

## üîë **Tips for Interviewers**:
- **Adjust Weights for Role**: Depending on the role (e.g., Junior vs Senior), you can adjust the weight of certain categories. For senior roles, emphasize **Experience** and **Advanced C++ Concepts**. For junior roles, focus more on **Technical Skills** and **Problem Solving**.
- **Consider Overall Fit**: While scores are important, also consider how the candidate's experience and technical skills align with your team's needs.
